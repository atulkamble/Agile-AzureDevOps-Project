# Agile Azure DevOps Project 🚀  

This repository follows Agile methodologies using Azure DevOps for project tracking, CI/CD, and automation.  

## 📌 Features  
- Agile work tracking (User Stories, Tasks, Bugs)  
- Automated CI/CD using Azure Pipelines  
- Code versioning with Git  
- Deployment to Azure App Services/Kubernetes

### **Overview**  
The **Agile Azure DevOps Project** is designed to implement Agile methodologies within **Azure DevOps**, enabling seamless software development, project tracking, continuous integration (CI), and continuous deployment (CD). This project ensures efficient team collaboration, automated build and release processes, and streamlined DevOps workflows.  

### **Key Features**  
- 📌 **Agile Work Management** – Track user stories, tasks, and bugs using Azure Boards.  
- 🔀 **Git Version Control** – Implement feature branching strategies with Azure Repos.  
- ⚙ **Automated CI/CD Pipelines** – Build, test, and deploy using Azure Pipelines.  
- ☁ **Cloud Deployment** – Deploy applications to **Azure App Services** or **Kubernetes**.  
- 📊 **Monitoring & Analytics** – Integrate **Application Insights** for performance tracking.  

### **Technology Stack**  
- **Version Control:** Git, Azure Repos  
- **CI/CD:** Azure Pipelines (YAML-based)  
- **Cloud Services:** Azure App Service, Kubernetes  
- **Project Management:** Azure Boards (Scrum, Kanban)  
- **Programming Languages:** JavaScript, Python, or any preferred tech stack  
- **Monitoring:** Azure Monitor, Application Insights  

### **Project Goals**  
✅ **Improve development speed** with Agile sprints and task tracking.  
✅ **Automate CI/CD workflows** to reduce manual errors and accelerate deployments.  
✅ **Enhance collaboration** with Git branching strategies and Azure Boards.  
✅ **Ensure high availability** using cloud infrastructure with monitoring.  

## 📂 Project Structure  
- `src/` → Application source code  
- `docs/` → Documentation  
- `.gitignore` → Files to exclude from version control  
- `azure-pipelines.yml` → CI/CD Pipeline configuration  

## 🚀 Getting Started  

1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://dev.azure.com/your_organization/Agile-AzureDevOps-Project.git

```
## **🚀 Instructions to Run the Agile Azure DevOps Project**  

Follow these steps to set up and run the project using **Node.js** and **Express**.  

---

### **1️⃣ Navigate to the Project Directory**  
Ensure you are inside the project folder before running any commands.  

```bash
cd /Users/atul/Downloads/Agile-AzureDevOps-Project
```

---

### **2️⃣ Initialize a New Node.js Project**  
Create a `package.json` file by running:  

```bash
npm init -y
```

This will generate a default `package.json` file for your project.  

---

### **3️⃣ Install Dependencies**  
Install **Express.js** (or replace it with your required dependencies):  

```bash
npm install express
```

If your project requires additional dependencies, install them similarly:  

```bash
npm install <dependency-name>
```

---

### **4️⃣ Verify Files**  
Ensure that `package.json` exists in your project directory:  

```bash
ls
```
Expected output:  
```
package.json  node_modules/  index.js  ...
```

---

### **5️⃣ Install All Dependencies**  
If your project has a `package.json` with dependencies listed, run:  

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all dependencies specified in `package.json`.  

---

### **6️⃣ Start the Project**  
Run the application with:  

```bash
npm start
```

If you get a **"Missing script: 'start'"** error, add the following to your `package.json` under `"scripts"`:  

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node index.js"
}
```

Then, re-run:  

```bash
npm start
```

---

### **7️⃣ Verify the Server is Running**  
If using **Express.js**, open your browser and go to:  

🔗 [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)  

You should see:  
```
Hello, Agile Azure DevOps Project!
```
