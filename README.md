## 🚀 Getting Started  

1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://dev.azure.com/your_organization/Agile-AzureDevOps-Project.git

```
## **🚀 Instructions to Run the Agile Azure DevOps Project**  

Follow these steps to set up and run the project using **Node.js** and **Express**.  

---

### **1️⃣ Navigate to the Project Directory**  
Ensure you are inside the project folder before running any commands.  

```bash
cd /Users/atul/Downloads/Agile-AzureDevOps-Project
```

---

### **2️⃣ Initialize a New Node.js Project**  
Create a `package.json` file by running:  

```bash
npm init -y
```

This will generate a default `package.json` file for your project.  

---

### **3️⃣ Install Dependencies**  
Install **Express.js** (or replace it with your required dependencies):  

```bash
npm install express
```

If your project requires additional dependencies, install them similarly:  

```bash
npm install <dependency-name>
```

---

### **4️⃣ Verify Files**  
Ensure that `package.json` exists in your project directory:  

```bash
ls
```
Expected output:  
```
package.json  node_modules/  index.js  ...
```

---

### **5️⃣ Install All Dependencies**  
If your project has a `package.json` with dependencies listed, run:  

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all dependencies specified in `package.json`.  

---

### **6️⃣ Start the Project**  
Run the application with:  

```bash
npm start
```

If you get a **"Missing script: 'start'"** error, add the following to your `package.json` under `"scripts"`:  

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node index.js"
}
```

Then, re-run:  

```bash
npm start
```

---

### **7️⃣ Verify the Server is Running**  
If using **Express.js**, open your browser and go to:  

🔗 [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)  

You should see:  
```
Hello, Agile Azure DevOps Project!
```

### **✅ Your Project is Now Running! 🚀**  
Let me know if you face any issues! 😊

Here’s a structured setup for **Azure Boards Work Items, Backlog, Sprints, Queries, Delivery Plans, and Analytics Views** for your **Agile Azure DevOps Project**.  

---

## **1️⃣ Creating Azure Board Work Items**  
Azure Boards provide **User Stories, Tasks, Bugs, Epics, and Features** to track work.

### **Work Item Types & Examples**
| **Work Item Type** | **Title** | **Description** |
|--------------------|-----------|---------------|
| **Epic** | Implement CI/CD Pipeline | Automate build and deployment |
| **Feature** | Setup Azure Pipelines | Create YAML-based CI/CD pipelines |
| **User Story** | As a developer, I want a Git branching strategy | Use Git Flow for efficient version control |
| **Task** | Setup Express.js Server | Install dependencies and configure the Node.js app |
| **Bug** | Fix API CORS issue | Resolve CORS policy error in the backend |

📌 **Steps to Create Work Items**  
1. Go to **Azure DevOps** → Select your project.  
2. Click **Boards** → **Work Items**.  
3. Click **New Work Item** and choose the type (**User Story, Task, Bug**).
